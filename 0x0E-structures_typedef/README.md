# struct and typedef

Structure/ struct is a composite data type declaration that defines a physically grouped list of variables to be accessed via a single pointer or by the struct declared name which returns the same address.

The struct data type can contain other data types, so it is used for mixed data type records such as `hard drive directory entry` (file length, name, extension, pysical address etc)
